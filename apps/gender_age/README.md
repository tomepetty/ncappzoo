# gender_age
## Introduction
This app does facial detection and age/gender inference using the Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick 2. 

The example does face detection on a camera frame using face-detection-retail.0004, crops the detected faces, then does age and gender inference using the age-gender network. When running, the app shows the realtime camera preview while overlaying, a box around faces (color coded for gender), and an estimated age.  All models can be found on the [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo). This sample uses pre-compiled IRs, so the model optimizer is not utilized.

## Building the Example

To run the example code do the following :
1. Open a terminal and change directory to the sample base directory
2. Type the following command in the terminal: ```make all```

## Running the Example

After building the example you can run the example code by doing the following :
1. Open a terminal and change directory to the sample base directory
2. Type the following command in the terminal: ```make run``` 

When the application runs normally, another window should pop up and show the feed from the webcam/usb cam. The program should perform inferences on faces on frames taken from the webcam/usb cam.

## Prerequisites
This program requires:
- 1 NCS device
- OpenVINO 2019 R2 Toolkit
- OpenCV 3.3 with Video for Linux (V4L) support and associated Python bindings*.
- A webcam (laptop or USB)


*It may run with older versions but you may see some glitches such as the GUI Window not closing when you click the X in the title bar, and other key binding issues.

Note: All development and testing has been done on Ubuntu 16.04 on an x86-64 machine.

## Makefile
Provided Makefile has various targets that help with the above mentioned tasks.

### make run or make run_cpp
Runs the sample application.

### make help
Shows available targets.

### make all
Builds and/or gathers all the required files needed to run the application.

### make data
Gathers all of the required data need to run the sample.

### make deps
Builds all of the dependencies needed to run the sample.

### make default_model
Compiles an IR file from a default model to be used when running the sample.

### make install-reqs
Checks required packages that aren't installed as part of the OpenVINO installation. 

### make uninstall-reqs
Uninstalls requirements that were installed by the sample program.
 
### make clean
Removes all the temporary files that are created by the Makefile.
